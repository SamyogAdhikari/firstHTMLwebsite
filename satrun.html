            Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after
             Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth.[18][19] 
             It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn 
             is over 95 times more massive.[20][21][22] Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and
              agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle.

Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds).
