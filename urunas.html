            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary
             radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar
              in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ
               from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists
                often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the gas
                 giants. Uranus' atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary
                  composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water,
                   ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.[15] It has the
                    coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature
                     of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F), and has a complex, layered cloud structure with
                     water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer
                      of clouds.[15] The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.[14]
