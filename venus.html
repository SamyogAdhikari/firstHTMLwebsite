            Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman
             goddess of love and beauty. As the second-brightest natural object 
             in the night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, 
             on rare occasion, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.[15][16]
              Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far
               from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising 
               in the east a bit before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth
                days.[17] With a rotation period of 243 Earth days, it takes longer
                 to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System 
                 and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus (meaning the
                  Sun rises in the west and sets in the east).[18] Venus does not have
                   any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among planets in
                    the Solar System.[19]
